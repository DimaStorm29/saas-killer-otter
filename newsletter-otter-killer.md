# SaaS Killer #1: The Otter Killer is Here

Stop paying $120/year for Otter.ai. Unlimited, private transcription for free.

---

## What You're Getting

Today, we're releasing the first **Automation Arbitrage** script: **The Otter Killer**.

A simple Python script that:
- Transcribes any audio file
- Runs locally on your machine
- Costs nothing after initial setup
- Keeps your data private

## Why Otter.ai Sucks

**Otter.ai charges:** $10/month ($120/year)

**For what?**
- Cloud storage of your audio
- Basic AI transcription (Whisper-based)
- A mobile app

**The real cost:**
- Your audio sits on their servers forever
- You pay forever for features you could have locally
- You don't own the tech

## How Otter Killer Wins

**The script:**
- Uses OpenAI's Whisper model (same tech Otter uses)
- Runs 100% locally - your data never leaves your machine
- One-time setup: `pip install openai-whisper`
- Unlimited use, forever
- You control the code

**Installation:** Takes 2 minutes. That's it.

## Get the Script

**P.S.** If this saves you money, share it. SaaS subscriptions are a silent killer. Fire them.
